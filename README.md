# Viable Data tech test
## Setup for running applications and tests
Activate virtual environment and install dependencies
```
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run application
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/api/` to view the API schema

### Run tests
```
python3 manage.py test
```

## Notes
* I used DRF Spectacular which automatically generates the Open API spec and uses it to serve a working API client on a specific URL. This makes it easy to develop as you can see your changes quickly and can even try the API out. It also importantly documents the API and since it's autogenerated from the code, it's never out-of-date.
* I used `black`, `isort` and `autoflake` for linting. In a real project these would be configured using a pyproject.toml file and be a part of pre-commit hooks. The result would be that all committed code would automatically be linted in a consistent way, avoiding unimportant discussions over code formatting.
* I didn't understand what "Company history" meant, so I've ignored it

## Assumptions made

## What I would add with more time
* Users/authentication
* Validation to the fields. Examples:
  * Sort code should be 6 digits
  * National Insurance number should follow the rules (regex-based validation would be sufficient)
* A static type checker such as `mypy` to enforce type safety. I didn't add it because getting it to behave with Django takes a bit of time and I didn't want to spend extra time doing that.
